//! D2GL's configuration, `ProjectD2/d2gl.json`, before a Glide launch.
//!
//! D2GL sizes a full-screen game from the monitor (`GetMonitorInfo`): its
//! window and its render target, before it renders anything. The stored
//! `screen.window_size_*` is only the size of a windowed game, which D2GL
//! clamps to the screen when it loads the configuration and sets to the
//! monitor's size when it saves it in full screen
//! (<https://github.com/Project-Diablo-2/d2gl/blob/55148de0aec79d487f5bcef1842cfdc3effd2f62/d2gl/src/win32.cpp#L351-L396>).
//! So the Launcher never writes the window size.
//!
//! On the desktop the Launcher writes nothing into the configuration; it
//! only reports when D2GL has not written it yet ([`configuration_absent`]).
//!
//! On the Android host a handheld cannot toggle Fullscreen comfortably, so
//! when D2GL has not written its configuration yet the Launcher writes one
//! (fixed first-launch settings) before the first Glide launch. An existing
//! configuration gets the first launch's cursor and full-screen values
//! ([`ANDROID_SCREEN`]: an imported one keeps a desktop player's, often
//! windowed with a locked cursor, which the X screen cannot use), and the
//! app's graphics profile ([`GraphicsProfile`]) sets its few `graphics`
//! values when it is not the profile last applied ([`PROFILE_RECORD`]);
//! nothing else in it is touched (the player changes D2GL's graphics in the
//! game, Ctrl+O, and those changes stay until the profile changes). The
//! configuration is the player's, so a value that cannot be written is
//! left as it is and the launch continues.
//!
//! D2GL also loads the DLLs its configuration names (`load_dlls_early`,
//! `load_dlls_late`) into the game. On the Android host other apps the player
//! lets into the game folder can edit the configuration, so before D2GL can
//! start the Launcher sets both to the values PD2 ships ([`pin_dlls`]), and
//! the game does not start when it cannot.
