//! The Control channel: the private, versioned connection between the
//! Android app and the Launcher engine (`pd2-launcher --engine`).
//!
//! The Android app creates a connected `AF_UNIX` stream socket pair and
//! starts the engine with its end as standard input, so the engine adopts it
//! without unsafe code. Every message is a frame: a 4-byte big-endian length,
//! then that many bytes of UTF-8 JSON. A frame larger than
//! [`MAX_FRAME_BYTES`] is a protocol error: one received closes the
//! connection, and one the engine would send is never sent.
//!
//! The app speaks first. Its `hello` names the protocol version and the
//! Android host facts; the engine answers `welcome` and only then starts its
//! service, or answers `refused` with the versions it speaks and exits. After
//! that the app sends `command`s and the engine sends a full `snapshot`
//! whenever what the app shows changes (never a delta), and a
//! `command_error` for a command it could not take, or that the Launcher
//! refused (its guard failure, which the desktop window shows as evidence).
//! When the app closes its
//! end, the engine requests a safe stop, waits for the service to finish, and
//! exits.
//!
//! The messages are the protocol's own types, not the Launcher's `Intent`
//! and `UiSnapshot`: the engine maps them both ways, so a change inside the
//! Launcher never changes what an Android app on the same protocol version
//! reads. Any change to a message bumps [`PROTOCOL`], with the Android app's
//! protocol version in step, and regenerates the golden fixtures the Android
//! app's decoder tests read (see the tests).
