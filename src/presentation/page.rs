//! The launcher's game page, rendered with GPUI Kit components.
//!
//! A shell that fills the window: a header that
//! is also the title bar, with the launcher's mark, the four step marks
//! (Check · Download · Install · Play) during setup and the window buttons;
//! a task pane that shows only the current task; and no footer: Back sits in
//! the bottom-left corner and the page's one action in the bottom-right.
//! Once the game is installed, Play stands alone in the middle with the
//! destinations along its foot. Every action and its gating comes from
//! [`DeckPresentation`]; this module only restates it in plain player
//! language and emits the same intents.
