//! The interrupted-stage marker.
//!
//! Before a stage that changes the Managed prefix in a way its own evidence
//! cannot resume (creating a new prefix, running a Vendor installer, or
//! importing a game), the installer records that stage in
//! `<root>/.pd2launcher-stage.json` while it holds the installation lease.
//! When the stage's step returned without an error, the installer marks the
//! record finished; it clears the marker only after a fresh audit proved
//! the stage's evidence. An audit that finds the marker beside evidence the
//! stage left part way reports `StageInterrupted`, which only a confirmed
//! Start over resolves, instead of `Indeterminate`.
//!
//! The games are proven by their files alone, and a file can be
//! there but short while it is written. So for a game stage that is not
//! finished, any file it wrote means the stage stopped part way; a
//! finished one is judged by its files.
